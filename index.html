            Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس
            غالي, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ
            ˈɣæːli];[5] born 15 June 1992), known as Mohamed Salah or Mo Salah,
            is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a right winger
            or forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt
            national team. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation
            and among the greatest African players of all time, he is known for
            his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.[6][7][8] Salah started
            his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon Al Arab,
            departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League
            titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11
            million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina
            and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the
            2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title
            bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017,
            Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9
            million. In his first season.

            Erling Haland

          <p>
            Erling Braut Haaland (né Håland; Urban East Norwegian: [ˈhòːlɑn];[5]
            born 21 July 2000) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays
            as a striker for Premier League club Manchester City and the Norway
            national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he
            is seen for his speed, strength, positioning, and finishing inside
            the box. In his debut Premier League season, Haaland broke the
            record for the most goals scored by a player in a single season,
            with 36.[6] Coming through the youth system, Haaland played for
            Norwegian sides Bryne and Molde, before relocating to Austria with
            Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019. His performances there earned him
            a move to Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, where he won the
            DFB-Pokal in 2021. In the summer of 2022, he transferred to
            Manchester City for a fee of €60 million (£51.2 million), and was
            instrumental in the club winning a continental treble in his debut
            campaign; his 52 goals across all competitions was the most ever for
            a Premier League player. Haaland was named the league's Young Player
            and Player of the Season, becoming the first player to win both
            awards in the same year.

            Real Madrid and the England national team. In 2023, he won both

            and won the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal; his performances in the 2022–23
